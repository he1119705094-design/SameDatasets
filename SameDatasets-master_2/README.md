# Aligned Datasets Improve Detection of Latent Diffusion-Generated Images

Official repository of [Aligned Datasets Improve Detection of Latent Diffusion-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11835). The specific instructions for training the models and reproducing the plots can be found in the **training_code** and **testing_code** directories.

## Pretrained Models

Our pre-trained fake image detectors can be found below,
- [Ours](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ACoiwC8BM0NpyhAwbKsyAk1Da-TAoRRy/view?usp=sharing) (ResNet-50 trained without sync'd batches)
- [Ours-Sync](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rn0hgAjTXeY7QTpCnx9lMGNPfrwvO1lO/view?usp=sharing) (ResNet-50 trained with sync'd batches)
- [Ours (shaders)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pqM8z10--509vS98yNTebI8OzvDqLPgI/view?usp=sharing) (ResNet-50 trained on shaders)
- [Ours-Sync (shaders)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDZe_P5xiAbELZLV-PmYK5Hkh_BG6Eah/view?usp=sharing) (ResNet-50 trained on shaders, with sync'd batches)
